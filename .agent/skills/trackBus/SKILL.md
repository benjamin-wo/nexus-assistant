name: trackBus
description: Starts a live bus tracking session for a specific bus stop in Singapore. Polls LTA DataMall for arrival updates at an interval chosen by the agent (e.g. every 60s if the bus is far, every 20s if it's close), and sends a live Telegram update each poll. Automatically stops when the bus has arrived or after a maximum watch time. Use when the user asks to track, watch, or monitor a bus stop or specific bus service number.

Use this skill to start a background polling loop that tracks live bus arrival timings and sends Telegram updates at agent-chosen intervals. The agent should dynamically set the interval based on how far away the next bus is.
